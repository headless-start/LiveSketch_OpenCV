# Real-Time Sketch Generation using Adaptive Thresholding
This Python project demonstrates real-time sketch generation from a webcam feed using OpenCV. The program captures video frames from the camera, processes the frames using various image processing techniques (such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and Canny edge detection), and generates a sketch-like output.
Features
# Real-time edge detection using Canny Edge Detection.
Adaptive Thresholding applied to the edges to create sketch-like visuals.
Displays live webcam feed with the processed sketch as output.
